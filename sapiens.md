# Sapiens Outline

## Part 1: The Cognitive Revolution

### 1. human evolution
- Homo sapiens developed around 200k-150kya in E Africa (anatomically modern humans)
- when Homo sapiens left Africa (70kya), most of Eurasia was already inhabited by Neanderthals, Denisovans, Erectus
- What drove the evolution of the massive human brain over 2 million years? not clear if/why it’s a good strategy for survival on savannah

### 2. What was the cognitive revolution?
- 70-30kya: suddenly lots of new inventions: boats, bow & arrows, art, religion, burials, commerce ... aka culture (behaviorally modern humans)
- emergence of fictive language
	- made large-scale cooperation possible
	- started cultural evolution (cultural ratchet) - human life can change much quicker than biological evolution (“fast lane”)

### 3. Life for hunter-gatherers (70kya-12kya)
- basically, life was pretty good (“first affluent societies”).. didn’t have to work as many hours, ate well
- our modern minds are adapted to hunter-gatherer lifestyle; now interacting with post-industrial environment (causes some problems)
- each tribe had its own culture (galaxy of cultures); “there hasn’t been a single natural way of life”
- curtain of silence: we cannot reconstruct specific events, religious beliefs, wars, philosophies of ancient foragers (big gap in our understanding of history)

### 4. Impact of hunter-gatherers on ecosystem
- mass extinction of megafauna in Australia and America (they hadn’t evolved with humans, so were vulnerable)

## Part 2: The Agricultural Revolution

### 5. Agricultural Revolution intro
- what was it?
	- around 12kya: people start devoting “almost all their time and effort to manipulating the lives of a few animal and plant species”
	- marked by population increases: for nomadic foragers, babies/children were a burden, so they space them out; farmers actually need more children to work the fields + there is surplus food, so birth rate rises
- “history’s biggest fraud”
	- cons: more violence, less varied diet, harder work, less secure (reliant on single crop), higher population density, higher spread of disease, creation of elite class
	- luxury trap: small, incremental “improvements” in society added up to a worse lifestyle, and there’s no going back
	- animals: domestication of animals led to cruel treatment, miserable lives

[ how did humans organize themselves in unnaturally large numbers? ]

### 6. imagined orders
- food surpluses led to towns, cities, eventually kingdoms; relied on myths to bond unnaturally large groups of people
- created social codes to maintain social order: human rights, hierarchies; although imaginary, must actually be believed (doublethink)
- “evidence” imagined order is real: embedded in material world (architecture), shapes desires (consumerism), inter-subjective (eg money)

### 7. written language
- as societies got more complex, needed to store a lot of data (taxes); developed written language to store data outside human brain
- first written language (3500 BC) were partial scripts, not intended to replicate spoken language, but to keep track of records
- written language changes the way humans think and view the world
	- bureaucracy and data organization
	- mathematics (physics/engineering don’t use spoken language)
	- computers 

[ end ]


### 8. imagined orders create categories of humans, cause discrimination
- complex human societies seem to require hierarchies and discrimination: caste sytems, racial heirarchies, rich and poor
- vicious cycle: chance historical events are perpetuated
	- cultural prejudices → discriminatory laws → poverty and lack of education → cultural prejudices
- gender hierarchies: why are almost all human societies dominated by men? not historical chance since it’s so ubiquitous, but we don’t really know


## Part 3: The Unification of Humankind

### 9. arrow of history
- cultures are constantly in flux: because they are resolving inconsistencies like freedom vs equality
	- there are no “authentic” cultures, if defined as something that develops independently, free from external influences
- the arrow of history is towards a universal global order
	- everyone follows same geopolitical, economic, legal, and scientific system
	- this species-level cooperation would seem strange to earlier sapiens, who were so used to us-vs-them mindset
	- driven by money, empires, religion

### 10. money
- old systems: favors and bartering
- for more complex economies, money is required (bartering doesn’t work)
	- exchange one thing for another (convertibility), don’t need to seek out apple-craving shoemaker (sell the apples for money, and then buy shoes)
	- compare value of different commodities, need only O(n) rates rather than O(n^2) pairwise rates
	- store, transport wealth conveniently
- money based on trust, inter-subjective, collective imagination
	- unites people, whole empire/trade network have to have trust in same currency
	- spreads: the fact that someone values gold/silver, makes others value it too

### 11. empires
- empires are the reason for reduction in human diversity: obliterated numerous peoples and formed larger groups (Romans eliminate Celtic culture in Spain)
- universal empire: rule for benefit of people, inclusive
- cycle of empires: small groups establishes big empire, imperial culture is forged, adopted by subject peoples, subject people demand equal rights, founders lose dominance, culture continues to develop
- problems with wholesale denunciation of empires:
	- all human cultures are in part the legacy of empires, there are no “authentic” cultures
	- much of human culture forged by empires: philosophy, art, justice, charity
	- layers: British empire ← Mughal empire ← Gupta empire, which cultural layers should be removed

### 12. religion
what is a religion: system of human norms and values+belief in superhuman order
supernatural religions
animism: hunter-gatherers, local
polytheism: early farmers create gods to help with fertility and abundant harvests, created hierarchy (plants & animals → Sapiens → gods), mix/match local gods
monotheism: Christianity first to believe their God is everyone’s God, their rules are universal → should evangelize (unites people that it spreads to)
dualism: good vs evil; Zoroastrianism, Gnosticism, Manichaeism
natural-law religions
premodern: Buddhism (suffering arises from craving, liberated by training the mind to experience reality as it is), Stoicism/Cynicism/Epicureanism
modern: liberalism, Communism, capitalism, nationalism

### 13. two notes about history
determinism & the hindsight fallacy
“the present situation is neither natural or inevitable”
“what looks inevitable in hindsight was far from obvious at the time”
people w superficial understanding focus on the possibility that was realized, and act as thought it was inevitable
cultural memes
history disregards the happiness of individuals; no evidence those cultures beneficial to humans survive and those harmful fall
“successful cultures are those that reproduce their memes, regardless of the cost/benefits to their human hosts”


## Part 4: The Scientific Revolution

### 14. intro to science
3 qualities of science
admits its own ignorance & that could be proven wrong
centrality of observation, generalized by mathematical theories
produces technology (knowledge is power)
scientific progress
people used to think golden age in past, we are stagnant or deteriorating, we can only learn from ancient texts (Christianity, Islam)
admitting ignorance + seeing new powers of science = people start to believe that progress is possible
ultimate goal of science in 21st century: curing death
ideological backing: science doesn’t have an agenda but its funding does
is-ought problem: science can say what is, but politics/ideology says what we ought to study and what we ought to do with the power

### 15. empires + science
why Europe?
center of power shifted from Asia to Europe only between 1750-1850
Europe had been laying the foundations from 1500-1750 (science + capitalism)
Asia just wasn’t interested in, for example, competing with Europe to conquer America (never made an attempt, tho technologically possible)
discovery of America made Europeans realize they didn’t have all the answers (parallels with science itself), piqued curiosity
began age of exploration of geography, botany, archaeology, anthropology
British studied linguistics, archaeology of conquered lands (India)

### 16. capitalism + science
growth cycle: trust in future → credit (+ discoveries/progress) → growth
capitalist creed: “the profits of production must be reinvested in increasing production”
banks, govts print money (pump credit into the system), science foots the bill; if scientists can’t come through, that’s a bubble
capitalism + empire
joint stock companies: VOC and British East India Company
counties that handle credit well were more successful
problems with the free-market
“markets by themselves offer no protection against fraud, theft, and violence”
“it cannot ensure that profits are gained in a fair way, or distributed in a fair manner” (slavery, exploitation... driven by greed and indifference)

## Part 4.5: The Industrial Revolution

### 17. the industrial revolution
revolution in energy
1825 - first steam engine train in England (Newcastle)
“people became obsessed with the idea that machines and engines could be used to convert one typ of energy into another”, “the IR has been a revolution in energy conversion”
revolution in agriculture
industrial production methods: tractors, artificial fertilizer, incectisized 
mistreatment of animals: like slave trade, not fueled by animosity, but by indifference; neglects subjective needs of animals (playing, bonding)
smaller % of humans required to farm, enabled specialization & urban IR
rise of consumerism
throughout history scarcity → frugality; after IR & production, consumerism is positive and frugality is a disease to be cured
in past, aristocrats lived luxuriously and peasants were frugal
capitalist-consumerist ethic: now the rich take care of their assets (invest, greed) and the poor go into debt with consuming (buy, crave)

### 18. effects of industrial revolution
time
in past, relied on movements of sun and growth cycles of plants
after IR, precision and uniformity sanctified; invention of timetables, standardized time; “almost everything we do has to be done on time”
the collapse of the family and the community
role of welfare, health, education, bank, police used to be family/intimate community; now run by state bureaucracies and the market
strong states/markets → strong, but alienated individuals; evolution designed us to live in communities, hence modern alienation
“in the last 2 centuries, the intimate communities have withered, leaving imagined communities to fill in the emotional vacuum” (nation and consumer tribe)
constant changes to social order
premodern times: social order was hard and rigid, leaders “safeguard the traditional order or even go back to some lost golden age”
the only characteristic of modern times is “incessant change” to social order
despite this elastic order, modern times very peaceful
peace
rise of the state (courts & police) → large decrease in local violent crime
collapse of British, French, Soviet empires after 1945 rather peaceful (some exceptions: Algeria, Vietnam)
few wars: nuclear weapons (mutually assured destruction), wealth in human capital not material (can’t be captured), foreign trade & investment, peace-loving elite; Global Empire enforces peace within its borders (we aren’t really independent nations anymore)

### 19. happiness
how does wealth, health, community correlate with subjective well-being
“happiness does not really depend on objective conditions ... it depends on the correlation between objective conditions and subjective expectations”
how does biochemistry correlate with subjective well-being
happiness = pleasant sensations caused by hormones
evolution created homeostasis of happiness levels
meaning
“if you have a why to live you can bear almost any how” Nietschze 
“any meaning that people ascribe to their lives is just a delusion” 
Buddhism
suffering arises from craving ephemeral feelings

### 20. the future
biological engineering
genetic engineering: “our ability to modify genes is outpacing our capacity for making wise and far-sighted use of the skill”
inevitable: “possibility of prolonging human life indefinitely, conquering incurable diseases, and upgrading cognitive & emotional abilities”
cyborgs
bionic arms controlled by thought, brain-computer interfaces
inorganic life
machine learning, AI
uploading a brain to a computer
singularity: all the concepts that give meaning to the world become irrelevant
