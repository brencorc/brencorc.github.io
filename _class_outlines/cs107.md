## Lab 2: C pointers/arrays, void *


### arrays and pointers, pointer arithmetic


```
void binky(int a[], int *b) // these are treated **exactly** the same
{
    b[2] = 9;
    a[2] *= 10;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int arr[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
    int *ptr = arr;     // these are almost the same, but slightly different (eg sizeof)
                        // ptr is the address to the first element in arr 

    binky(arr, ptr);
}
```



### function pointers, callback functions, generic functions


```
void *bsearch(  const void *key, 
                const void *base, 
                size_t nitems, 
                size_t size, 
                int (*compar)(const void *, const void *))
```


generic parameter: use` void *`

cast to (char *) before doing arithmetic


```
void *ptr = ...;
void *elem = (char *)ptr + 5 * sizeof(int);
```


**const parameters**: If you are passing a pointer to a function and your code will not modify the data it points to, pass it as a const pointer. For example, if you will not modify the contents of a string, pass it as a const char * instead of a char *.


### pass by reference


```
int x = 15;
updateVar(10, &x);

void updateVar(int newX, int *x) {
    *x = newX;
}
```



### passing pointers by reference (**)


```
int *x = 0xff;
helper(0xfe, &x);

void helper(int* newX, int **x) {
    *x = newX;
}
```


**c strings, cvec/cmap**


## Lab 3: Bits, bytes, ints

char, short, int, long, unsigned, 

two’s complement for signed ints

Truncation and sign extension

Mixed signed and unsigned comparison operations

Bitwise operators and using bytes as collections of booleans (bit masks)


```
| & ~ >> <<
```



## Lab 4: Floating point

IEEE floating point, mini-float

floating point arithmetic


```
    N × 2^(E-127) × 1.S
 sign   exponent significand
    0   10000110 10100000100000000100000
```



## Lab 5: Assembly

**assembly**

registers

common commands: lea, mov

logical, arithmetic commands


## Lab 6: Runtime Stack

Caller/callee protocol for function calls, parameter passing, call/return, and management of stack housekeeping. Use this understanding to explore stack features: why recursion works, locals are cheap, how variable arguments work, and caller/callee-saved registers. 


## Lab 7: Compilation process

build process



*   preprocessor: removes comments, handles #define, removes macros (#ifdef)
*   compiler: converts to assembly
*   assembler: converts to binary
*   linker: symbol table

code optimization: what optimizing compiler do and don’t do (loop unrolling, common subexpression elimination, )

who detects what?


## Lab 8: Memory

memory hierarchy: registers → caches → memory → disk

writing cache-friendly code

malloc, heap allocator
